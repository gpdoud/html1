		<p>I've done a lot of things in my history to get me to this point in my career.</p>
		<p>Working my way through college, I worked in a factory and got my first IT job in computer operations.</p>
		<p>My first programming job was using COBOL on an IBM Mainframe 370/138 computer with a grand total of one-half a meg of memory! Yes; 1/2 Meg of memory to run a multi-national company.</p>
		<p>Later, I worked for a number of companies in development roles with an occasional detour into sales and marketing.</p>
		<p>I began my teaching career with another code school and found out how much teaching others programming was a rewarding career. I plan to do it for a long time.</p>
		<p>I came to MAX Technical Training and hope for a very long career helping those students get the new positions they want in the software development field.</p>
